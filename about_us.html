    <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">
        My name is Omankeh J Samura. I am an aspiring wellness coach who wants to help connect all the black owned
        small businesses around the United States and globe to a website that can uphold an e-commerce store to supply
        the people with their wellness needs. I hope to one day connect my e-commerce store to the international market
        for healthcare products along with my wellness coaching to one day work with the African Union in providing an
        international African market.
